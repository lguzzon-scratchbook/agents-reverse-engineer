Implement the task step by step, creating/modifying files as needed. After implementation:
1. Verify all changes work correctly
2. Run any required validation (tests, build, lint)
3. Make a final commit summarizing the implementation

# Evaluation Criteria
Evaluate each implementation on a 1-5 scale (1=poor, 5=excellent) for these criteria:

1. **Code Quality** (30% weight): Clean code, proper structure, good naming, maintainability
2. **Completeness** (25% weight): All requirements implemented, no gaps or TODOs
3. **Test Coverage** (20% weight): Comprehensive tests, edge cases covered
4. **Error Handling** (15% weight): Robust error handling, validation, edge cases
5. **Adherence to Spec** (10% weight): Follows the plan, meets requirements exactly

# Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
